      <p>Sup fam - Welcome to RapKing beta. </p>
      <p>
        RapKing is a gamified social media platform where you'll be able to post your raps, view
        others, rate raps, get points for your own, and see where you stand among others in your
        demographic (age, location, gender).
      </p>
      <p>RapKing is still a work in progress, so expect it to be incomplete and have issues.</p>
      <p>Checkback for updates homie - see you soon.</p>
